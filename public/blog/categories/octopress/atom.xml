    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today i decided my self to use octopress, the big reason i movin to this new stuff is a new challange, i can learn more about Ruby programming through this stuff, as ma lecturer said &lsquo;life simple and learn forever&rsquo; <!-- more --></p>

<p>The big problem (depend on me) was getting errors when i running
<code>
rake generate
rake preview
</code>
on my &lsquo;darkfury&rsquo; netbook, setting everything set up and working correctly is probably going to be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Ma effort was not useless, finally i found the problem, it was different rake version, and i settle it down by using</p>

<p><code>
bundle exec rake generate
bundle exec rake preview
</code>
and hola, it works. When i seen it well i immediately opened my heroku, and deploy it there. Next i setting up domain name, and all was done!</p>

<p>Next time i have create ma own octo theme and put it on ma github repo, the question is will i leave wordpress and keep dating with octopress? nope, i will use both, coz i love them both :D</p>
