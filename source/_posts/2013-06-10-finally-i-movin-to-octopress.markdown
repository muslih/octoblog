Today i decided my self to use octopress, the big reason i movin to this new stuff is a new challange, i can learn more about Ruby programming through this stuff, as ma lecturer said 'life simple and learn forever' <!-- more -->

The big problem (depend on me) was getting errors when i running
```
rake generate
rake preview
```
on my 'darkfury' netbook, setting everything set up and working correctly is probably going to be a pain in the ass.

Ma effort was not useless, finally i found the problem, it was different rake version, and i settle it down by using  

```
bundle exec rake generate
bundle exec rake preview
```
and hola, it works. When i seen it well i immediately opened my heroku, and deploy it there. Next i setting up domain name, and all was done!

Next time i have create ma own octo theme and put it on ma github repo, the question is will i leave wordpress and keep dating with octopress? nope, i will use both, coz i love them both :D
